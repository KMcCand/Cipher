# Cipher
AP Computer Science A Final Exam. A menu driven program that allows users to encode and decode inputs based on a randomly generated or predetermined cipher. The cipher contains three rings, each with every letter of the alphabet and the digits 0 through 9. 

To encode a letter:
   It is located on the inner ring
   The corrosponding letter on the outer ring is located on the middle ring
   The corrosponding letter on the outer ring is returned 
   The inner ring is rotated one step clockwise, and if it makes a full revolution, the middle ring is rotated one step as well. When the middle ring has made a full revolution, the outer ring is then rotated.
   
To decode, the reverse happens.
