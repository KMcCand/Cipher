# Cipher
AP Computer Science A Final Exam. A menu driven program that allows users to encode and decode inputs based on a randomly generated or predetermined cipher. The cipher contains three rings, each with every letter of the alphabet and the digits 0 through 9. 

To encode a letter, it is located on the inner ring. Then, the letter lining up with it on the outer ring is located on the middle ring. The letter lining up with that letter on the outer ring is returned. Finally, the inner ring is rotated one step clockwise.
Once the inner ring has made a full revolution, the middle ring is rotated one step clockwise. When the middle ring has made a full revolution, the outer ring is then rotated.
   
To decode, the reverse happens.
